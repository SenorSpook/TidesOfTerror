TidesOfTerrorV0.1 - the "IT WORKS" update
------------------------------------------
-Added new ItemType: Currencies, which will drop in the same categories as runes and perfect gems for now.

--Seed of Corruption: A powerful currency that has unpredictable powers corrupting your items for better or worse.

--Splinter of Salvation: A nifty currency to have on hand when you find that unique you wanted, but has bad rolls. With Salvation Splinters you can reroll a unique item's rolls. THIS DOES NOT WORK FOR UPPED BASES.

-Added new cube recipes: Unique Item + Seed of Corruption = Corrupted Item + Random New Stat

-Added new cube recipes: Unique Item + Splinter of Salvation = Unique Item (stats re-rolled).

-Added new cube recipes: Boots + Stam Pot = Boots + 10/20/30% FRW depending on the base (basic, exceptional, elite).

-Added 36 new uniques, with many more to come. Some created on my own, labeled (ToT). Others are inspired by my favorite RPG games, Path of Exile (PoE) and World of Warcraft (WoW).

-Every class starts with a unique charm that makes their attacks splash, works only for weapons and bows.

-Modified itemratio.txt poorly, item ratios need further testing
